# Web Reconnaissance Lab – Test Project

## Overview
This repository contains a **legal and controlled web reconnaissance lab** performed on the demo target `testphp.vulnweb.com`.  
The objective of this lab was to **learn reconnaissance techniques** using common security tools and to document findings in a professional report.

---

## Target
- URL: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`  
- Scope: Non-intrusive and safe scanning for educational purposes only.

---

## Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Nmap** | Network and port scanning |
| **Dirb** | Directory enumeration and hidden resource discovery |
| **Nikto** | Web server vulnerability scanning |

---

## Methodology
1. **Port and service discovery** using Nmap to identify open ports and running services.  
2. **Directory enumeration** using Dirb to locate hidden paths and endpoints.  
3. **Vulnerability scanning** using Nikto to detect web server misconfigurations and potential risks.  
4. **Report compilation** documenting results, risks, and recommendations.

---

## Findings
- **Nmap:** Multiple open HTTP services found, server version disclosed (nginx 1.19.0), some non-standard ports exposed.  
- **Dirb:** No sensitive directories were found, and rate-limiting appears to be in place.  
- **Nikto:** No critical vulnerabilities or misconfigurations detected, suggesting basic server hardening.  

---

## Conclusion
The lab demonstrates **real-world reconnaissance practices** in a safe environment.  
No high-risk vulnerabilities were found on the target, but open services and exposed server information highlight the importance of monitoring and hardening web applications.
